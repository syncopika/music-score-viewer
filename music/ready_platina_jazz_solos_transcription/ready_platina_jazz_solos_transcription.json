        "This is a transcription of the trombone and trumpet solos as played in 「READY!!」 from the album 'Platina Jazz ~Anime Standards Vol.4~'.",
        "The soloists are Karl Frid (trombone) and Nils Janson (trumpet).",
        "I absolutely love the trombone solo - it's so lyrical, not too difficult + easy on the fingers (at least for trumpet!), and melodically interesting but not crazy weird or nonsensical (imo). The trumpet solo is pretty good as well :).",
        "The song is composed by Kosaki Satoru but this particular jazz arrangmenet was arranged by Martin Persson."
