        "This is a mixed ensemble arrangement of \"A Page of My Story\", the ending song for the anime Princess Principal. The composer is 高橋 諒.",
        "What you see/hear here is a bit different from my initial arrangement as posted on SoundCloud and YouTube because I had failed to arrange some parts (particularly the flute) in a realistic manner. I think this should be more suitable for an actual performance.",  
        "Thanks to Mats Helgesson for the awesome Maestro Clarinet Base soundfont I'm using for the clarinet 1 part. (and of course thanks very much to the creators of the other soundfonts I'm using, whoever they may be)."
